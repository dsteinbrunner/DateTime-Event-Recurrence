TODO list for Perl module DateTime::Event::Recurrence

* check what are the minimum dependencies requirements 
  and fill in at Makefile.PL

* new units:

  weekly_year  => first day of first week of year, such that
                  we can get week #34 by adding 33 weeks!

* possible syntax to generate a datetime "matrix":

    $r = DT::E::R->monthly (
                       days => [ 4, 15, 18 ],
                       hours => [ 10, 20 ] );

* experimental code

# this is supposed to combine 2 events.
# it doesn't work because the intersection in 
# the "next" method is not returning a proper value,
# due to incomplete "iterate" implementation in Set::Infinite.

# "function"
sub join {
    my ($self, $other) = @_;
    return bless {
        set => $self->as_set->union( $other->as_set )
    }, ref $self;
}

# "subroutine"
sub join_to_event {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{set} = $self->as_set->union( $_[0]->as_set );
    delete $self->{next};
    delete $self->{previous};
    return $self;
}
