0.00_06

- works with multiple durations like
    $r = DT::E::R->monthly (
                       duration => \@durations );
- durations _must_ be pre-sorted.
- _doesn't_ work with "matrix" durations like
    $r = DT::E::R->monthly (
                       days => [ 4, 15, 18 ],
                       hours => [ 10, 20 ] );
